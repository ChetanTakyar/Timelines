                    <p>
                        This version of tvOS came pre-installed with Apple TV 4K (3rd Generation). It also added support for the Nintendo Switch's JoyCons and Pro Controllers and additional Bluetooth and USB Game Controllers. HDR10+ gained support in the Apple TV app, as well as an addition of video previws. On screen intensity metrics were made available with Fitness+.
                        <br><br>
                        Later minor updates made chages such as: including a redesigned Siri interface and voice recognition for up to six users; support for "Hey Siri" command with AirPods family headphones; real time lyric support in Apple Music; better language support; as well as plenty of bug fixes.

                    <h3>tvOS 15</h3>
                    <p>
                        Excitedly, for those of us who love to use voice assistants, this version of tvOS added support to be controlled with a HomePod or a HomePod Mini. Building upon the "Shared for You" feature on iOS, tvOS adds a new "Shared with You" row in the TV app for movies and TV shows shared in Messages. Also the video player interface got a nice redesign.
                        <br><br>
                        Building upon the capability tvOS sought to bring you with your smart speakers, Homepod Minis now had the ability to act as a stereo pair for your TV. That's not all for great sound as they also added support for Spatial Audio on Apple TV 4K with AirPods Pro and AirPods Max.
                        <br><br>
                        Later updates brought great new features such as: a new memories feature in the photos app; new store tab in the Apple TV app; support for subscribing to Apple Music Voice subscription plan; new screensavers; an "Up Next" queue and volume controller in the video player; purchase authentication with iOS and watchOS devices; support for displaying multiple security cameras at once and in watching in picture in picture; as well as many more bug fixes.

                    <h3>tvOS 14</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of my favourite features, throughout various operating systems has always been picture in picture mode. In this release, third party apps gained the ability to be able to use picture in picture. App icons were also reduced in size and displayed more rounded corners than previously. The Control Center also got an overhaul to it's design.
                        <br><br>
                        This version of tvOS also gained support for Microsofts controllers: Elite 2 and Adaptive Xbox One. Later versions gave it access to more controllers including PlayStation DualSense Controllers. HomeKit gained camera feeds for HomeKit enabled security cameras. Control Center is also able to control these HomeKit devices. The HomePod can be also used as a speaker.

                        tvOS 13 debuted with a redesigned home screen, with full screen video previews. App icons were made to be more rounder and the Control Center was first added in this update. Support for multiple Apple IDs were added in this update for built in apps. Scrolling lyrics were also added to the Music app.
                        <br><br>
                        A new app was also added to this version: Apple Arcade. Apple's video game service used on iOS, macOS and here on tvOS. Also new screensavers were added and only the TV and menu button wakes from sleep. Support for the Xbox One and Playstation Dual Shock 4 controllers were added.
                        <br><br>
                        Later updates added: support for AirPods Pro and other stability improvements and bug fixes.
