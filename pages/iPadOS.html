                    <h3>iPadOS 13</h3>
                    <p>iPadOS, released in the fall of 2019, is a version of iOS 13 that's designed to run on Apple's iPads. According to Apple, iPadOS is built on the same foundation as iOS, but with powerful new capabilities created for the larger display of the iPad.
                        <br></br>
                        First and foremost, iPadOS includes almost all of the features available in iOS 13, such as performance optimizations, a new systemwide Dark Mode, a revamped Photos app, a Find My app, Sign In with Apple, updated Maps, and tons more, so for an overview of the new iOS 13 features, make sure to check out our iOS 13 roundup.
                        <br></br>
                        The iPadOS roundup below highlights the iPad-specific features that are part of iPadOS, rather than the iOS 13 features available on both platforms.
                        <br></br>
                        iPadOS features a new Home screen for the iPad, which shrinks down the app icon size so you can fit more apps on each page. You can also now add Today Widgets from the left side of the screen onto the Home screen itself for easier access to your widgets and at-a-glance info like news headlines, weather, events, and more when your iPad is in landscape mode.
                        <br></br>
                        The Split View and Slide Over multitasking options now support multiple windows from the same app, so you can do things like open two Safari windows side by side. When in Slide Over view, there's a new option to view and switch between multiple apps with a new Slide Over card interface.
                        <br></br>
                        App Expos√©, available when holding down an app's icon, lets you view all of the open windows from a particular app, and there's an option to swap between them with a tap, making it much easier to switch between your open windows on iPad.
                        <br></br>
                        Tapping on the corner of the iPad's display with an Apple Pencil opens up Markup, which can now be used for anything from webpages and documents to screenshots and emails. Apple has introduced a redesigned tool palette for quick access to tools, color palettes, shapes, a ruler, an object eraser, and a new pixel eraser. The new tool palette is available in Markup and is also available to third-party developers as an API.</p>
