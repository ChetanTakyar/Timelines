                    <h3>iPadOS 16</h3>
                    <p>
                        Apple in June 2022 previewed the latest version of the iPad's operating system, iPadOS 16. iPadOS 16 introduces the Weather app on iPad for the first time, a host of new collaboration features, updates to apps like Notes, Mail, and Messages, a series of "pro" features, including an entirely new multitasking experience, full external display support, display zoom, and much more.
                        <br></br>
                        The Weather app comes to the iPad for the first time in iPadOS 16, offering a new system of forecast modules for more detailed information such as hourly temperature and precipitation over a 10 day period.
                        <br></br>
                        The Notes app can improve handwritten notes by making words straighter and neater, and users can Scribble with the Apple Pencil while using Dictation for the first time. It is possible to insert shapes like boxes and arrows into the drawing area using a finger or the Apple Pencil, and also add typed text in editable boxes and rotate images within the drawing area. In addition, screenshots can be added to Quick Notes for the first time.
                        <br></br>
                        Desktop-class apps enable new capabilities optimized for the iPad's display across apps like Calendar, Contacts, Photos, and Mail, with more advanced system elements and interactions, including a consistent undo and redo experience across the system, a redesigned find-and-replace experience, customizable toolbars, and more.
                        <br></br>
                        Based on this, the Files app is significantly improved in iPadOS 16, adding more convenient navigation buttons, easier access to common controls such as duplicate and rename, the ability to change file extensions and view folder size, a unified open and save panel, and sortable columns.
                        <br></br>
                        iPadOS 16 includes a range of "pro" features that are exclusive to some iPad models with the M1, A12X, and A12Z chips. Stage Manager brings a new way to multitask with multiple overlapping windows and full external display support, Reference Mode allows the iPad to match exact requirements in color workflows, Display Zoom provides more on-screen space, and virtual memory swap expands the amount of memory available to apps.

                    <h3>iPadOS 15</h3>
                    <p>Apple in June 2021 introduced iPadOS 15, which went on to be released on September 20, 2021. iPadOS 15 introduced a new Home Screen design with integrated widgets and the App Library, system-wide fast note-taking with Quick Note, new features for FaceTime calls, a redesigned Safari experience, new tools to reduce distractions, and more.
                        <br></br>
                        Multitasking was redesigned in iPadOS 15 with a new multitasking menu at the top of apps, letting users enter Split View or Slide Over more easily, quick access to the Home Screen when using Split View, a new shelf allows for easier multitasking with apps that have multiple windows, and more, making it easier to work with multiple apps at once.
                        <br></br>
                        Users can now place widgets among apps on the iPad's Home Screen pages, and there is a new, bigger widget option. Apple is also bringing the App Library to the iPad for effortless organization of apps, accessible directly from the dock.
                        <br></br>
                        Quick Note is a new iPad feature that offers a fast and easy way to take notes anywhere across the system. Users can bring up Quick Note anywhere to jot down a thought and add links, providing an easy way to get back to exactly what they were looking at. In the Notes app, there are new Tags, a Tag Browser, and tag-based Smart Folders. Shared notes now feature mentions to notify collaborators and an Activity view.
                        <br></br>
                        Focus is a new feature that can filter notifications and apps based on what a user wishes to focus on at a certain time. When a user's Focus is blocking incoming notifications, their status will be displayed to others in Messages. iPadOS will suggest a Focus for different occasions, such as work hours or winding down for bed, using on-device intelligence, but users can also create a custom Focus. When a Focus is set on one Apple device, it automatically applies to other Apple devices.
                        <br></br>
                        Live Text is a new feature that uses on-device intelligence to recognize text in a photo that users can search for, highlight, and copy. Spotlight can now search for photos by location, people, scenes, objects, and text. Spotlight now offers web image search and richer results for actors, musicians, TV shows, and movies. Enhanced results for contacts show recent conversations, shared photos, and location if it is shared through Find My.</p>

                        <h3>iPadOS 14</h3>
                        <p>iOS 14 got a new Home Screen and a feature that lets widgets be pulled from the Today Center and placed among apps, but that feature was not extended to iPadOS. The iPadOS interface looks largely the same, but widgets have been redesigned in the Today Center.
                            <br></br>
                            Widgets also still show up when the iPad is in landscape mode, and there are new size options for widgets, but only four widgets are supported and they're not displayed in portrait mode. Smart Stack, the widget feature that uses on-device intelligence to cycle through useful widgets throughout the day, is supported.
                            <br></br>
                            iPadOS is also missing the App Library feature added in iOS 14, which provides a look at all of the apps that you have installed in one easy-to-see view, and it does not have the Translate app that's also new to iPhone.
                            <br></br>
                            Apps like Photos and Files have been improved in iPadOS with new, less obtrusive slide over sidebars and pull-down menus that provide quicker access to app functions without the need to switch away from what you're doing.
                            <br></br>
                            The Search interface has a new, more compact design that doesn't take over the entire display, and it's faster than ever and more akin to the Finder on Mac, able to deliver more relevant search results.
                            <br></br>
                            As with iOS 14, iPadOS includes compact Phone and FaceTime calls that don't take over the entire screen, and Siri is also presented in a compact format with a small Siri icon at the bottom of the display.

                    <h3>iPadOS 13</h3>
                    <p>
                        iPadOS, released in the fall of 2019, is a version of iOS 13 that's designed to run on Apple's iPads. According to Apple, iPadOS is built on the same foundation as iOS, but with powerful new capabilities created for the larger display of the iPad.
                        <br></br>
                        First and foremost, iPadOS includes almost all of the features available in iOS 13, such as performance optimizations, a new systemwide Dark Mode, a revamped Photos app, a Find My app, Sign In with Apple, updated Maps, and tons more, so for an overview of the new iOS 13 features, make sure to check out our iOS 13 roundup.
                        <br></br>
                        The iPadOS roundup below highlights the iPad-specific features that are part of iPadOS, rather than the iOS 13 features available on both platforms.
                        <br></br>
                        iPadOS features a new Home screen for the iPad, which shrinks down the app icon size so you can fit more apps on each page. You can also now add Today Widgets from the left side of the screen onto the Home screen itself for easier access to your widgets and at-a-glance info like news headlines, weather, events, and more when your iPad is in landscape mode.
                        <br></br>
                        The Split View and Slide Over multitasking options now support multiple windows from the same app, so you can do things like open two Safari windows side by side. When in Slide Over view, there's a new option to view and switch between multiple apps with a new Slide Over card interface.
                        <br></br>
                        App Exposé, available when holding down an app's icon, lets you view all of the open windows from a particular app, and there's an option to swap between them with a tap, making it much easier to switch between your open windows on iPad.
                        <br></br>
                        Tapping on the corner of the iPad's display with an Apple Pencil opens up Markup, which can now be used for anything from webpages and documents to screenshots and emails. Apple has introduced a redesigned tool palette for quick access to tools, color palettes, shapes, a ruler, an object eraser, and a new pixel eraser. The new tool palette is available in Markup and is also available to third-party developers as an API.
