                    <h3>iOS 16</h3>
                    <p>
                        Apple in June 2022 previewed the new version of the iPhone's operating system, iOS 16. iOS 16 introduces redesigned, customizable Lock Screens with widgets, the ability to edit and delete messages, improved Focus modes, an iCloud Shared Photos Library for families, major improvements for apps like Mail, Home, and Wallet, and much more.
                        <br><br>
                        The Lock Screen is fully redesigned in iOS 16. The new Lock Screen design is highly customizable with a wide range of options for widgets, typefaces, a multilayered effect for images, and animated wallpapers. Users can create multiple different Lock Screens linked to Focus modes.
                        <br><br>
                        Notifications now roll up from the bottom of the screen to be less invasive. Live Activities help users keep track of current events, such as a workout or a sports game, in real-time directly from the Lock Screen. Focus modes are improved with easier setup, Focus filters, linking to individual Lock Screens and Apple Watch faces, and more configuration options.
                        <br><br>
                        There are significant updates to the Messages app with the ability to edit or delete messages, mark messages as unread, and start a SharePlay session. Users can now seamlessly hand off FaceTime calls to other devices and an all-new Freeform app provides a platform for collaboration on a digital whiteboard.
                        <br><br>
                        In the Mail app, Search has been completely overhauled and there are new features to schedule emails, cancel delivery, and receive follow-up reminders.
                        <br><br>
                        The Health app adds new features for Medications and the Fitness app is now available to users that do not have an Apple Watch. The Home app is also fully redesigned and re-engineered, while Safari now features passkeys and Shared Tab Groups.
                        <br><br>
                        Notes and Reminders offer new sorting options, the Maps app gains multi-stop routing and enhanced integration with transit cards, and the News app contains dedicated sports features. iCloud Shared Photo Library provides a convenient way to share a collection of photos with family members, along with improvements to photo editing, albums, and Memories.

                    <h3>iOS 15</h3>
                    <p>
                        Apple in June 2021 introduced the latest version of its iOS operating system, iOS 15, which was released on September 20, 2021. iOS 15 introduces new features for FaceTime calls, tools to reduce distractions, a new notifications experience, added privacy features, complete redesigns for Safari, Weather, and Maps, and more.
                        <br><br>
                        Notifications have been redesigned in iOS 15, adding contact photos for people and larger icons for apps. To reduce distraction, a notification summary collects notifications together for delivery at an appropriate time and arranges notifications by priority.
                        <br><br>
                        Focus is a new feature that can filter notifications and apps based on what a user wishes to focus on at a certain time. When a user's Focus is blocking incoming notifications, their status will be displayed to others in Messages. iOS will suggest a Focus for different occasions, such as work hours or winding down for bed, using on-device intelligence, but users can also create a custom Focus. When a Focus is set on one Apple device, it automatically applies to other Apple devices.
                        <br><br>
                        Safari features a completely new design. Controls are now easier to reach with one hand and give more focus to a webpage's content. There is a new, compact tab bar that floats at the bottom of the screen so users can easily swipe between tabs. Tab Groups allow users to save tabs and easily access them at any time across devices. There is also a customizable start page and web extensions for the first time.
                        <br><br>
                        The Maps app now offers a new 3D view in cities with significantly enhanced details, showing buildings, pedestrian crosswalks, bike lanes, and more. There is a new city-driving experience with added road details and improved Transit features, such as pinned favorite lines, notifications to disembark, and AR walking directions.
                        <br><br>
                        iOS 15 brings voice isolation and Spatial Audio to FaceTime calls so that voices sound as if they are coming from where the person is located on the screen. FaceTime also supports Portrait mode and offers a new grid view to see more faces at the same time. SharePlay is a new feature that allows users to share media together in sync during a FaceTime call. Users can also generate shareable links to a scheduled FaceTime call, which can also be opened on Android and Windows devices.

                    <h3>iOS 14</h3>
                    <p>
                        Apple in June 2020 introduced a new version of its iOS operating system, iOS 14, which was released on September 16, 2020. iOS 14 was one of Apple's biggest iOS updates to date, introducing Home screen design changes, major new features, updates for existing apps, Siri improvements, and many other tweaks that streamline the iOS interface.
                        <br><br>
                        First and foremost, iOS 14 brings a redesigned Home Screen that includes support for widgets for the first time. Widgets can be dragged from the Today view right onto the Home Screen, and can be pinned in different sizes.
                        <br><br>
                        With a Smart Stack feature, the iPhone can use on-device intelligence to surface the right widget based on time, location, and activity. Each Home Screen page can display widgets customized for work, travel, sports, and more. The Today section where widgets are housed has also been redesigned, and there's a widgets gallery where users can choose new widgets from apps and customize those widgets.
                        <br><br>
                        Swiping all the way to the end of the app pages on an iPhone opens the new App Library, which is an interface that shows all of the apps on your iPhone to see everything at a glance. Apps are organized into your folder system, but there are also Apple-created folders like Suggestions and Apple Arcade that intelligently surface apps. New app downloads can be added to your Home Screen or kept in the App Library to keep your Home Screen cleaner.

                    <h3>iOS 13</h3>
                    <p>
                        First up, Apple continued on with its optimization trend introduced in iOS 12, making iOS 13 faster and more efficient than ever. App update times have improved, app launch times are two times faster, app download sizes have been reduced by up to 50 percent, and Face ID is 30 percent faster.
                        <br><br>
                        There's a new systemwide Dark Mode option, which changes the entire look of the operating system from light to dark. You can choose either option, or have Dark Mode come on at sunset or on a custom schedule. All native Apple apps feature Dark Mode support, and third-party apps can use Dark Mode APIs to add Dark Mode integration.
                        <br><br>
                        Apple overhauled the Photos app, introducing a new feature that curates your entire Photos library and shows you a selection of highlights from your life by day, month, or year. Photos and videos are intelligently organized, making it easier to browse and relive your favorite memories.
                        <br><br>
                        iOS 13 makes most of your photo editing tools available for video editing, letting you rotate, crop, and apply filters to videos. In the Camera app, you can make Portrait Lighting adjustments, moving the light closer or further away depending on the look you're going for. There's also a new High-Key Mono lighting effect for creating monochromatic looks.
                        <br><br>
                        iOS 13 introduces a streamlined, less obtrusive volume HUD for the first time, and there's a now an option to download apps of any size over an LTE connection, untethering you from WiFi.
                        <br><br>
                        Apple is adding a Sign in with Apple privacy feature that gives you a convenient and data safe way to sign into apps and websites. Your Apple ID is able to authenticate your account via Touch ID or Face ID, and developers see a unique random ID rather than your real info.

                    <h3>iOS 12</h3>
                    <p>
                        With iOS 12, Apple doubled down on performance, working from top to bottom to make iPhones and iPads faster and more responsive. Apple has made improvements on devices both old and new, and iOS 12 has been designed to run on all devices able to run iOS 11.
                        <br><br>
                        Apple introduced new customizable Animoji called Memoji, which you can personalize to look like you. Memoji, Animoji, and other fun effects can be used both in Messages and with FaceTime through the new Effects camera. A Group FaceTime feature lets you video chat with up to 32 people at one time, but requires iOS 12.1.4 or later.
                        <br><br>
                        Siri is a whole lot smarter in iOS 12. Siri can answer questions about famous people, food, and motorsports, and there's a whole new Shortcuts feature that's built on the Workflow app. With Shortcuts, you can build a huge range of automations using first- and third-party apps, which can then be activated with Siri voice commands.
                        <br></br>
                        Siri suggestions and Shortcuts show up on the Lock screen and when you pull down to search, with Siri able to do more than ever before with the third-party Shortcuts integration. You can create Shortcuts using a dedicated Shortcuts app available from the iOS App Store, and the app offers dozens of pre-made options to make it easy to get started.
                        <br><br>
                        Grouped Notifications have been added to make it easier to view and manage all notifications from an app at once, and there's a new Instant Tuning feature for tweaking notifications as they come in. You can press on a notification to turn off notifications for a given app or set them to Deliver Quietly, which sends them to Notification Center but not the Lock screen. Siri also offers suggestions to turn off notifications for apps you don't use anymore, and all in all, notifications are less intrusive in iOS 12.
                        <br><br>
                        Apple built a comprehensive set of time management and focus tools into iOS 12, starting with a new Screen Time feature. Screen Time provides weekly activity reports detailing how you used your iOS device, including how much time you spend in each app, how often you pick up your phone, how long you spend on the iPhone or iPad, and which apps are sending the most notifications.

                    <h3>iOS 11</h3>
                    <p>
                        iOS 11 brought many changes to iOS. Some major highlights were; The lock screen and Notification Center were combined, allowing all notifications to be displayed directly on the lock screen.
                        The control center was completely redesigned, combining all pages into a single unified page. It also brought the ability to rearrange the position of the controls, some of which could be used with 3D Touch for quick access to additional options.
                        <br><br>
                        The App Store also received its first major design overhaul since iOS 7 to focus on editorial content and daily highlights. A "Files" file manager app allowed access to files stored locally on-device and in iCloud and other cloud services. With this addition, users could also for the first time save files downloaded using Safari right on their iPhone without any third-party apps.
                        <br><br>
                        Siri was updated to translate between languages and use a privacy-minded "on-device learning" technique to better understand a user's interests and offer suggestions.
                        The camera introduced new settings for improved portrait-mode photos and utilized new encoding technologies to reduce file sizes on newer devices.
                        In a later release of iOS 11, Messages was integrated with iCloud to better synchronize messages across iOS and macOS devices. A previous point release also added support for person-to-person Apple Pay payments.
                        <br><br>
                        Further, iOS 11 introduced the ability to record the screen, which could be enabled by adding it to the control center in Settings. It also introduced rudimentary forms of drag-and-drop functionality,
                        Support for augmented reality allowing users to "place" virtual objects in the real world and interact with them using their iPhone.
                        <br><br>
                        For the first time, certain new features were only available on iPad. Some of these features were; an always-accessible application dock that could be access by dragging up from the bottom of the screen, cross-app drag-and-drop allowing users to share photos, files, and links easier than ever, adding a new easier way to split-screen apps by simply dragging an app from the dock on to another already open app, the "split" could then be resized to make one app bigger or small depending on what the user wanted.
                        <br><br>
                        iOS 11 was also the first version of iOS to drop support for 32-bit apps and for 32-bit processors, meaning iOS 11 only supported devices with a 64-bit processor. Upon installing iOS 11, if a user tried to open a 32-bit application that had not yet been updated to 64-bit, iOS would simply refuse to run it. iOS 10.3 included a popup upon launching a 32-bit application to warn users about the upcoming change and a new menu in Settings that allowed users to quickly identify what apps on their device would not be compatible with the iOS 11 update.

                    <p>
                        iOS 10 incorporates changes to 3D Touch and the lock screen.
                        <br><br>    
                        There are new features to some apps: Messages has additional emojis and third-party apps can extend functionality in iMessage, Maps has a redesigned interface and additional third-party functions, the Home app manages "HomeKit"-enabled accessories, Photos has algorithmic search and categorization of media known as "Memories," and Siri is compatible with third-party app-specific requests, such as starting workouts apps, sending IMs, using Lyft or Uber or to use payment functions. 
                        <br><br>
                        iOS 10 is the final version to support 32-bit devices and apps. In iOS 10.3, Apple introduced its new file system, APFS.

                    <p>
                        iOS 9 incorporated many feature updates to built-in apps. Most notably, Notes received the ability to draw sketches with different tools, image insertion, prominent visual appearance for website links and map locations, and advanced list formatting; an all-new Apple News app aggregates articles from different sources; and Apple Maps received mass transit support, although in a limited number of locations at launch. 
                        <br><br>   
                        Major new system updates include proactivity, where Siri and advanced search are combined to make the operating system more contextually aware of information (such as time and location), and can provide the user with information ahead of time. For searching, the proactive intelligence can display instant results in a widget-like format, including weather, sports, news, and more. iOS 9 also added multiple forms of multitasking to the iPad. 
                        <br><br>
                        iOS 9.3, Apple added a Night Shift mode that changes the color of the device's display to a warmer, less "blue light" containing shade, to reduce any negative eye health effects on users' circadian rhythms. Additionally, iOS 9 brought new user experience functions, including Quick Actions, and Peek and Pop, based on the touch-sensitive display technology in the iPhone 6S. Quick Actions are shortcuts on home screen app icons. Users can preview ("Peek") at content without moving away from the current screen before they enter ("Pop") the previewed content into full view.

                    <h3>iOS 8</h3>
                    <p>
                        iOS 8 incorporated significant changes to the operating system. It introduced a programming interface for communication between apps,[2] and "Continuity", a cross-platform (Mac, iPhone, and iPad) system that enables communication between devices in different product categories, such as the ability to answer calls and reply to SMS on the Mac and iPad.
                        <br><br>    
                        Continuity includes a "Handoff" feature that lets users start a task on one device and continue on another. Other changes included a new Spotlight Suggestions search results feature that provides more detailed results, Family Sharing, where a family can link together their accounts to share content, with one parent as the administrator with permission controls, an updated keyboard with QuickType, providing contextual predictive word suggestions and Extensibility, which allows for easier sharing of content between apps.
                        <br><br>
                        Third-party developers got additional features to integrate their apps deeper into the operating system, including support for widgets in the Notification Center, and the ability to make keyboards that users can replace the default iOS keyboard with.

                    <h3>iOS 7</h3>
                    <p>
                        iOS 7 introduced a completely redesigned user interface, a design credited to a team led by Apple's former senior vice president of design, Jony Ive.
                        <br><br>
                        The new look, featuring flatter icons, a new slide-to-unlock function, and new animations, was described by Ive as "profound and enduring beauty in simplicity". 
                        <br><br>
                        The new design was implemented throughout the operating system, including the Notification Center, which was updated with three tabs offering different views of information; notifications visible on the lock screen; a redesigned Siri voice assistant offering visual indicators; and a Control Center offering easy access to the most commonly used features.
                        <br><br>
                        iOS 7 also introduced AirDrop, a wireless sharing technology; CarPlay, phone and car integration; and automatic app updates in the App Store.

                    <p>
                        iOS 6 added a new Apple Maps app, replacing Google Maps as the default mapping service for the operating system; a dedicated Podcasts app, as a central location for podcasts; and a Passbook app, for managing different types of tickets, boarding passes, coupons, and loyalty cards.
                        <br><br>
                        The App Store received a visual overhaul, bringing a card-based app layout as well as tweaks to search algorithms. Facebook was integrated into the operating system, incorporating status messages, like buttons, and contact and event synchronization to several of Apple's apps.
                        <br><br>
                        New privacy controls allow users more fine-grained app permissions, as well as an option to prevent targeted advertising. Siri was added to more devices, and updated with more functionality, including the ability to make restaurant reservations, launch apps, retrieve movie reviews and sports statistics, and read items from the Notification Center.
