                    <h3>iOS 11</h3>
                    <p>iOS 11 brought many changes to iOS. Some major highlights were; The lock screen and Notification Center were combined, allowing all notifications to be displayed directly on the lock screen.
                        The control center was completely redesigned, combining all pages into a single unified page. It also brought the ability to rearrange the position of the controls, some of which could be used with 3D Touch for quick access to additional options.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The App Store also received its first major design overhaul since iOS 7 to focus on editorial content and daily highlights. A "Files" file manager app allowed access to files stored locally on-device and in iCloud and other cloud services. With this addition, users could also for the first time save files downloaded using Safari right on their iPhone without any third-party apps.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Siri was updated to translate between languages and use a privacy-minded "on-device learning" technique to better understand a user's interests and offer suggestions.
                        The camera introduced new settings for improved portrait-mode photos and utilized new encoding technologies to reduce file sizes on newer devices.
                        In a later release of iOS 11, Messages was integrated with iCloud to better synchronize messages across iOS and macOS devices. A previous point release also added support for person-to-person Apple Pay payments.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Further, iOS 11 introduced the ability to record the screen, which could be enabled by adding it to the control center in Settings. It also introduced rudimentary forms of drag-and-drop functionality,
                        Support for augmented reality allowing users to "place" virtual objects in the real world and interact with them using their iPhone.
                        <br/><br/>
                        For the first time, certain new features were only available on iPad. Some of these features were; an always-accessible application dock that could be access by dragging up from the bottom of the screen, cross-app drag-and-drop allowing users to share photos, files, and links easier than ever, adding a new easier way to split-screen apps by simply dragging an app from the dock on to another already open app, the "split" could then be resized to make one app bigger or small depending on what the user wanted.
                        <br/><br/>
                        iOS 11 was also the first version of iOS to drop support for 32-bit apps and for 32-bit processors, meaning iOS 11 only supported devices with a 64-bit processor. Upon installing iOS 11, if a user tried to open a 32-bit application that had not yet been updated to 64-bit, iOS would simply refuse to run it. iOS 10.3 included a popup upon launching a 32-bit application to warn users about the upcoming change and a new menu in Settings that allowed users to quickly identify what apps on their device would not be compatible with the iOS 11 update.</p>

                <div class="timeline-time">
                    <h4>September 2017</h4>

                <div class="timeline-content">
                    <h3>iOS 10</h3>
                    <p>iOS 10 incorporates changes to 3D Touch and the lock screen.
                    <br/><br/>    
                        There are new features to some apps: Messages has additional emojis and third-party apps can extend functionality in iMessage, Maps has a redesigned interface and additional third-party functions, the Home app manages "HomeKit"-enabled accessories, Photos has algorithmic search and categorization of media known as "Memories," and Siri is compatible with third-party app-specific requests, such as starting workouts apps, sending IMs, using Lyft or Uber or to use payment functions. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        iOS 10 is the final version to support 32-bit devices and apps. In iOS 10.3, Apple introduced its new file system, APFS.</p>

                    <h3>iOS 9</h3>
                    <p>iOS 9 incorporated many feature updates to built-in apps. Most notably, Notes received the ability to draw sketches with different tools, image insertion, prominent visual appearance for website links and map locations, and advanced list formatting; an all-new Apple News app aggregates articles from different sources; and Apple Maps received mass transit support, although in a limited number of locations at launch. 
                    <br/><br/>   
                    Major new system updates include proactivity, where Siri and advanced search are combined to make the operating system more contextually aware of information (such as time and location), and can provide the user with information ahead of time. For searching, the proactive intelligence can display instant results in a widget-like format, including weather, sports, news, and more. iOS 9 also added multiple forms of multitasking to the iPad. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    
                    iOS 9.3, Apple added a Night Shift mode that changes the color of the device's display to a warmer, less "blue light" containing shade, to reduce any negative eye health effects on users' circadian rhythms. Additionally, iOS 9 brought new user experience functions, including Quick Actions, and Peek and Pop, based on the touch-sensitive display technology in the iPhone 6S. Quick Actions are shortcuts on home screen app icons. Users can preview ("Peek") at content without moving away from the current screen before they enter ("Pop") the previewed content into full view.</p>

                    <h3>iOS 8</h3>
                    <p>iOS 8 incorporated significant changes to the operating system. It introduced a programming interface for communication between apps,[2] and "Continuity", a cross-platform (Mac, iPhone, and iPad) system that enables communication between devices in different product categories, such as the ability to answer calls and reply to SMS on the Mac and iPad.
                    <br/><br/>    
                    Continuity includes a "Handoff" feature that lets users start a task on one device and continue on another. Other changes included a new Spotlight Suggestions search results feature that provides more detailed results, Family Sharing, where a family can link together their accounts to share content, with one parent as the administrator with permission controls, an updated keyboard with QuickType, providing contextual predictive word suggestions and Extensibility, which allows for easier sharing of content between apps.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Third-party developers got additional features to integrate their apps deeper into the operating system, including support for widgets in the Notification Center, and the ability to make keyboards that users can replace the default iOS keyboard with.     
                    </p>

                <div class="timeline-time">

                <div class="timeline-content">
                    <h3>iOS 7</h3>
                    <p>iOS 7 introduced a completely redesigned user interface, a design credited to a team led by Apple's former senior vice president of design, Jony Ive.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The new look, featuring flatter icons, a new slide-to-unlock function, and new animations, was described by Ive as "profound and enduring beauty in simplicity". 
                        <br/><br/>
                        The new design was implemented throughout the operating system, including the Notification Center, which was updated with three tabs offering different views of information; notifications visible on the lock screen; a redesigned Siri voice assistant offering visual indicators; and a Control Center offering easy access to the most commonly used features.
                        <br/><br/>
                        iOS 7 also introduced AirDrop, a wireless sharing technology; CarPlay, phone and car integration; and automatic app updates in the App Store.

                    <h3>iOS 6</h3>
                    <p>iOS 6 added a new Apple Maps app, replacing Google Maps as the default mapping service for the operating system; a dedicated Podcasts app, as a central location for podcasts; and a Passbook app, for managing different types of tickets, boarding passes, coupons, and loyalty cards.
                    </p>
                    <p>The App Store received a visual overhaul, bringing a card-based app layout as well as tweaks to search algorithms. Facebook was integrated into the operating system, incorporating status messages, like buttons, and contact and event synchronization to several of Apple's apps.
                    </p>
                    <p>New privacy controls allow users more fine-grained app permissions, as well as an option to prevent targeted advertising. Siri was added to more devices, and updated with more functionality, including the ability to make restaurant reservations, launch apps, retrieve movie reviews and sports statistics, and read items from the Notification Center.</p>
