                        Universal Control, which allows a single mouse and ketboard to interact with multiple Macs and iPads and move files quickly between machines with a simple drag and drop.
                        <br><br>
                        A new AirPlay option to AirPlay movies, games, photos and more from the iPhone and iPad to the Mac. The Mac can also be used as a speaker for multiroom audio.
                        <br><br>
                        An optional new tab design for Safari that better blends into the background and also Tab Groups to make it easy to switch betweeen different tasks without losing open tabs. These are synced across your devices and can be shared.
                        <br><br>
                        FaceTime supports spatial audio so voices sound like they're coming from visually. Voice Isolation cuts out background noise. There's also a Wide Spectrum sound mode for when there are multiple callers in one room. Portrait mode blurs the background behind you like on the iPhone camera.
                        <br><br>
                        SharePlay allows users to watch/listen to movies, TV and music, and share their screen in real time from FaceTime. Support is also available for third party apps.

                        Shortcuts comes to the Mac from iOS/iPadOS, allowing you to use all your current Shortcuts on macOS. Apple has designed a gallery of pre-built shortcut options, and the Shortcuts app is integrated throughout macOS for running shortcuts from the menu bar, Finder, Spotlight, Siri, and more.
                        <br><br>
                        Focus, also available on iOS, is designed to help you stay on task with modes for Work, Personal Life, and more, plus customizable options. Focus basically filters out notifications unrelated to your current activity, and lets people know you're unavailable. Focus set on one device syncs across all devices.
                        <br><br>
                        Notes adds a Quick Note option for jotting down notes in any app or while visiting any website, and Quick Note supports links from various apps. Notes has new collaborative features with mentions, an Activity View with edit history, and tags for organization. The Maps app has an interactive globe that can be used to explore different locations on Earth.
                        <br><br>
                        With Live Text, Macs use on-device machine learning to detect text in photos, which can be copy-pasted or otherwise interacted with just like typed text. Visual Lookup uses machine learning to provide details on animals, art, landmarks, plants, and more in photos, with these two features available across macOS.
                        <br><br>
                        Privacy features such as Mail Privacy Protection to prevent emails from using tracking pixels, and the Mac recording indicator now lets you know if a Mac app is using the microphone.

                        On M1 Macs, the third-generation Airpods, AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max offer Spatial Audio, and there are new Accessibility options. Note that there are multiple macOS Monterey features limited to M1 Macs, such as Live Text, Portrait Mode for FaceTime, detailed Maps, on-device keyboard dictation, and unlimited keyboard dictation.
