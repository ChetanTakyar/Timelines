                        Universal Control, which allows a single mouse and ketboard to interact with multiple Macs and iPads and move files quickly between machines with a simple drag and drop.
                        <br><br>
                        A new AirPlay option to AirPlay movies, games, photos and more from the iPhone and iPad to the Mac. The Mac can also be used as a speaker for multiroom audio.
                        <br><br>
                        An optional new tab design for Safari that better blends into the background and also Tab Groups to make it easy to switch betweeen different tasks without losing open tabs. These are synced across your devices and can be shared.
                        <br><br>
                        FaceTime supports spatial audio so voices sound like they're coming from visually. Voice Isolation cuts out background noise. There's also a Wide Spectrum sound mode for when there are multiple callers in one room. Portrait mode blurs the background behind you like on the iPhone camera.
                        <br><br>
                        SharePlay allows users to watch/listen to movies, TV and music, and share their screen in real time from FaceTime. Support is also available for third party apps.

                        <br><br>
                        Shortcuts comes to the Mac from iOS/iPadOS, allowing you to use all your current Shortcuts on macOS. Apple has designed a gallery of pre-built shortcut options, and the Shortcuts app is integrated throughout macOS for running shortcuts from the menu bar, Finder, Spotlight, Siri, and more.
                        <br><br>
                        Focus, also available on iOS, is designed to help you stay on task with modes for Work, Personal Life, and more, plus customizable options. Focus basically filters out notifications unrelated to your current activity, and lets people know you're unavailable. Focus set on one device syncs across all devices.
                        <br><br>
                        Notes adds a Quick Note option for jotting down notes in any app or while visiting any website, and Quick Note supports links from various apps. Notes has new collaborative features with mentions, an Activity View with edit history, and tags for organization.

                        With Live Text, Macs use on-device machine learning to detect text in photos, which can be copy-pasted or otherwise interacted with just like typed text. Visual Lookup uses machine learning to provide details on animals, art, landmarks, plants, and more in photos, with these two features available across macOS.
                        <br><br>

                        <h3> macOS 11 - Big Sur</h3>
                        <p>
                            macOS Big Sur refreshed the design of the UI in a big way. Such changes included the addition of iOS icons, a redesigned control center and tweaks to the colour palettes. Also for the first time, the main wallpaper was an abstract one versus the landscape pictures of the past.

                            Compared to iOS, the new macOS icons include more shading and highlights to give more of a three dimensional appearance.

                            The update to Control Center brings us a visually similar experience to that of the Control Center on iPadOS, with quick shortcuts to WiFi, Bluetooth and so on, which can also be controlled in Control Center without opening the settings.

                            The Notification Center was completely redesigned to match the aesthetic of the iOS widget page. The widgets are now clearer, cleaner and more powerful than they were before and the notifications group up.

                            This was also the first update to support Apple Silicon (ARM64), starting with the M1 processor. Any software that has not been ported to work on Apple's ARM processors are able to be run on Rosetta 2, a translation layer to allow made for Intel software to run natively. Performance on said apps and games were astronomically better than expected. They also introduced Universal 2 which allows developers to package their apps to run natively on ARM and x86 processors. This update also means that ARM Macs can now run supported iPad apps. 

                            Time Machine was updated to require encryption, where it was previously optional for local disks. However, network disks do not require encryption but are given the option. It is also no longer possible to restore the whole system with a Time Machine backup as the signed system volume is no longer backed up.
